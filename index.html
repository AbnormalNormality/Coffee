            <p>Hi, I'm Alia! I'm a transfem programmer from down under, who writes small Python scripts in their free time.</p>
            <p>I have diagnosed ASD (Autism), ADHD, OCD, and Anxiety, so I can have trouble talking and communicating, and I might not act to your standards. This is also why I'm called AbnormalNormality, because my normal is your abnormal.</p>
            <p>I'm also Pansexual and, <span class="smallText">unfortunately</span>, fall in love <i>very</i> easily.</p>
            <p>I also have <i>incredibly</i> low self-esteem, and get depressed very easily, as well as being very prone to panic attacks.</p>

        <summary>Activities</summary>
        <div class="contents">
            <p>I make small pieces of code in various languages. Though I prefer Python, I have also been learning C#, Unity, HTML, CSS, JS, F#, and Java.</p>

            <p><span class="suggested">I hope to one day make app, whether it be a useful programme or a game, that people actually use.</span></p>

            <p>But I don't program all the time, I also play games, just much less often. Some of my recently played games (some new, some replays) are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Minecraft (Java Edition)</li>
                <li>Stardew Valley</li>
                <li><a href="https://discord.gg/2wgfHBGAtH" target="_blank">Scrambled Scarlet</a> (check it out!)</li>
                <li>Bloons TD6</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Though my absolute <i>favourite</i> games are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Minecraft (Java Edition)</li>
                <li>Spore (mostly on disc)</li>
                <li>Hades II</li>
                <li>Skyrim SE</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I fricking <b>love</b> math, give me some simple algebra and I'll be entertained. y = mx + c is hype and you can't tell me otherwise.</p>

        <summary>Interests</summary>
        <div class="contents">
            <p>Alongside programming, I also enjoy Yu-Gi-Oh, and drawing.</p>
            <p>I have never lost a Yu-Gi-Oh match! <span class="smallText">Though I've never played competitively, and the last time I fought against someone other than myself was in primary school, but my point still stands.</span></p>

            <hr>

            <p>My favourite show by far is Doctor Who, of which I have watched all modern episodes (only a few classic episodes).</p>

            <p>I don't have a general rule for the music I like, but I usually <b>hate</b> stuff like Taylor Swift <del>and Sabrina Carpenter</del>. Some of my favourite artists (ranked) are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Jazz Emu <span class="smallText">(proud of the visual album Ego Death)</span></li>
                <li>Lemon Demon</li>
                <li>Weezer</li>
                <li>Murray Gold</li>
                <li>Weird Al</li>
                <li>Beethoven/Mozart/Vivaldi</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>

            <p>I also <i>really</i> like math. Something about all the calculations tickles my brain.</p>
            <p>I calculate a lot, every hour of every day I am trying to figure out what the most optimal move is. I do miscalculate these a lot thought.</p>
            <p>I believe everyone needs to be perfect, which isn't a very good mentality, especially since I'm not perfect myself, which causes issues for me.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>I go through phases of words I use, I currently like using:</p>

            <ul>

                <li>Yeaglesmeagle</li>

            <h3>Bob(cat) Idiboo</h3>
            <p>We found Bob as a stray living in our backyard and eventually adopted her. She's usually very grumpy, but has been getting more playful lately. I <i>think</i> she's 14 as of 2025?</p>

            <h3>Sylvie, Destroyer of Worlds</h3>
            <p>Born March 2024 (and adopted July), Sylvie is a tiny terror who will hopefully grow out of her tyrant phase. She loves terrorising her sister Bob and biting anything she can find.</p>

            <h3>Chickens & possums</h3>
            <p>I also have chickens and possums. Technically we don't <i>own</i> the possums, but they live in our house and they have a little box to hide in.</p>
            <p>As of February '25, we have 4 chickens:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Macy/Blacky</li>
                <li>Fluffy</li>
                <li>Poppy</li>
                <li>Pterry (the 'p' is silent)</li>
            </ul>


            <p>We had two chickens of the same breed but now we only have one and we don't know <i>which</i> one. It's more likely for Blacky to be the survivor but we all call them Macy.</p>

Well you see: Minecraft Bedrock is full of mobile players and players who play on low-end devices, who simply wouldn't be able to run the new combat system.</span>
